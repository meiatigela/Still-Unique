# Still-Unique

Digital assets can be unique too.
 
The uniqueness propriety of certain physical assets is brought to the digital world through non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

> NFTs are tokens that we can use to represent ownership of unique items.

"Still Unique" is a unique digital representation of a unique physical object- Casa do Monte.

Casa do Monte is the result of an original project by the architects Daniel Zamarbide and Leopold Banchini, executed at a specific and unrepeatable time throughout an irreproducible succession of events, at a rival location (38.7195146, -9.1324694). This view of Lisbon only exists in these geographical coordinates. No cut of pink and white marble is identical to that housing the fireplace, bathrooms and bedrooms. Casa do Monte is unique.

Still Unique is  merely a digital picture of Casa do Monte with dubious artistic value. But the two goods have uniqueness in common.

Until recently, uniqueness was not a property physical and digital goods could share:

> A copy of a file, like an .mp3 or .jpg, is the same as the original.

Original and copy could not be distinguished in the digital world. This property was introduced by NTFs.

It is technically impossible to create an NTF that is identical to Still Unique. Anyone with an internet connection can still download, screenshot, copy, and share this digital picture of Casa do Monte with dubious artistic value. But no one could copy the verifiably real thing. Still Unique is, in this sense, unique. 

One could question what added value this brings, if copying the digital picture (which is the ultimate object of the NTF) is still just as feasible. 

Also in physical goods, uniqueness is a property that drives value. Uniqueness is probably not a relevant property of Casa do Monte - the view is valuable because it is beautiful, not because it is unique (the ugliest views of Lisbon are just as unique). But, for other physical goods, uniqueness is the main driver of value. 

> anyone could duct tape a banana to the wall, but it wouldn't be Maurizio Cattelan's "Comedian"

The $120,000 paid for the piece does not reflect the buyer's valuation of easily reproducible duct-taped bananas, but rather the value of having the original duct-taped banana that sparked public debate. By the same token, the De Soles felt defrauded for having bought a fake Rothko because what they valued at $8.3 million was the ownership of the real thing (and not so much the quality of the painting).

What drives humans to put a high price tag on the verifiably real thing? We speculate that it may be related to the inflationary bragging rights that come with originals, but not with copies. And that uniqueness is an effective vehicle for sought-after identity assertion (e.g., having a limited vinyl edition by Daupe does more to assert you as an hip-hop head than just listening to Griselda tracks on Spotify that are available for all).

NFTs unlock the value of uniqueness for digital creators. Whatever the underlying driver of such value might be, opening access to it is probably a good thing.
